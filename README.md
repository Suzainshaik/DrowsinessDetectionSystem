# 🛡️ Drowsiness Detection System — Real-Time Eye Monitoring with Alerts
Stay Awake. Stay Safe.

This project is a real-time drowsiness detection system built using computer vision and facial landmark analysis. It tracks your eye movements through a webcam and sounds an alarm if signs of drowsiness are detected.

Whether you're building a smart driver-assistance feature or a productivity tool to keep users focused, this project demonstrates how AI can be used to detect human fatigue and respond instantly.
